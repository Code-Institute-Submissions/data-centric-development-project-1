# Your Project's Name
My project for Code Institute's Data Centric Development Project was to create an online recipe book with CRUD functionality, which I aptly named 'Oh Crumbs!'.

## UX
I started the UX process by looking at recipe websites, namely BBC Good Food as it’s a very popular resource for home cooks. I noted what a user expects to see from a recipe, such as preparation, cooking time, amount of people served etc. I then focused on who my target audience was, I decided on ‘plant eaters’, so there would be no meat, fish, dairy or eggs on the site.

My user story goes as follows:

As a plant-based eater, I want to have access to a website that has recipes I can read, contribute to, update and delete if I don’t think they fit the site.

As a site owner, I want to provide a platform for users to read, collaborate and manage a variety of plant-based recipes.

The website should be as intuitive as possible with clear points of interaction. Please find wireframes located in the ‘user research’ folder in the project.

## Features
Create - allows user to input own recipes
Read - users can browse a selection of recipes and look at individual
Update - the edit page let's users update existing recipes
Delete - recipes can be easily removed from the site

## Existing Features
Feature 1 - user can 'login' and username is saved for the session.

Feature 2 - access to a directory of recipes that a user can select individually to read.

Feature 3 - add recipe to the database.

Feature 4 - retrieve and edit recipes from db.

Feature 5 - delete any recipes that aren't suitable. A modal is used to confirm deletion.

## Features Left to Implement
Authenticated login - the project guidelines stated that authenticated login was not required. However, ff this project were to go live to the public, it would definitley require a username and encrypted password saved in the db to retrieve on each login. 

Recipe image - each recipe needs to be assigned a relevant image, denoting what the finished recipe looks like. There should be an upload buttton on both the add and edit recipe page, which allows a user to submit their own image.

Filter/sort functionality - users should be able to filter and sort the recipes based on their preferences.

## Technologies Used
Aside from the standard front-end technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript, this project uses:
<ol>
<li>[Materialize](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)</li>
* Front-end CSS and JS library.
<li>[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)</li>
* For appealing typography.
<li>[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)</li>
 * The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
<li>[Python](https://www.python.org/)</li>
* The backend programming language.
<li>[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)</li>
* Lightweight framework.
<li>[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/)</li>
* Used for templating and looping.
<li>[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)</li>
* The database to store and retreive recipes from.
