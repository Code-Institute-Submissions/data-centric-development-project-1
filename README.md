# Your Project's Name
My project for Code Institute's Data Centric Development Project was to create an online recipe book, which I aptly named 'Oh Crumbs!'.

## UX
I started the UX process by looking at recipe websites, namely BBC Good Food as it’s a very popular resource for home cooks. I noted what a user expects to see from a recipe, such as preparation, cooking time, amount of people served etc. I then focused on who my target audience was, I decided on ‘plant eaters’, so there would be no meat, fish, dairy or eggs on the site.

My user story goes as follows:

As a plant-based eater, I want to have access to a website that has recipes I can read, contribute to, update and delete if I don’t think they fit the site.

As a site owner, I want to provide a platform for users to read, collaborate and manage a variety of plant-based recipes.

The website should be as intuitive as possible with clear points of interaction. Please find wireframes and mockups located in the ‘user research’ folder in the project.

## Features
Create - allows user to input own recipes
Read - users can browse a selection of recipes and look at individual
Update - the edit page let's users update existing recipes
Delete - recipes can be easily removed from the site

## Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Each recipe needs to be assigned an individual image, denoting what the finished recipe looks like. There should be an upload buttton on both the add and edit recipe page, which allows the user to submit their own image.

## Technologies Used
Aside from the standard front-end technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript, this project uses:
<ol>
<li>Materialize</li>
* Front-end CSS and JS library
<li>Google Fonts</li>
* For appealing typography
<li>jQuery</li>
 * The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
<li>Python</li>
* The backend programming language
<li>Flask</li>
* For templating logic
<li>Jinja</li>
* Used for page structure and looping
<li>MongoDB</li>
* The database to store and retreive the recipes from
</ol>

## Manual Testing

#1) Functionality Testing

#2) Compatibility Testing

#3) Database Testing

#4) Performance Testing


## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

I'd like to thank the Tutor Support team at Code Institute who pointed me in the right direction with any issues I became particularly stuck on.
