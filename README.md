# Your Project's Name
My project for Code Institute's Data Centric Development Project was to create an online recipe book, which I named 'Oh Crumbs!'. 

## UX
I started the UX process by looking at recipe websites, namely BBC Good Food as it’s a very popular resource for home cooks. I noted what a user expects to see from a recipe, such as preparation, cooking time, amount of people served etc. I then focused on who my target audience was, I decided on ‘plant eaters’, so there would be no meat, fish, dairy or eggs on the site.

My user story goes as follows:

As a plant-based eater, I want to have access to website that has recipes I can read, contribute new recipes, update if necessary and delete if I don’t think they fit the site.

As a site owner, I want to provide a platform for users to read, collaborate and manage a variety of plant-based recipes.

The website should be as intuitive as possible with clear points of interaction. Please find wireframes and mockups located in the ‘user research’ folder in the project.

## Features
Create - allows user to input own recipes
Read - users can browse a selection of recipes and look at individual
Update - the edit page let's users update existing recipes
Delete - recipes can be easily removed from the site

## Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Each recipe needs to be assigned an individual image, denoting what the finished recipe looks like. There should be an upload buttton on both the add and edit recipe page, which allows the user to submit their own image.

## Technologies Used
Aside from HTML, CSS and Javascript this project uses:
<ol>
<li>Materialize</li>
<li>Google Fonts</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Python + Flask</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
</ol>

## JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

I'd like to thank the Tutor Support team at Code Institute who pointed me in the right direction with any issues I became particularly stuck on.
